What a year, started off building <MagicLink invertColor text="Brank" url="https://withbrank.com" />,
a proof of concept infrastructure for accessing financial data. Think Plaid for Africa.

Moved out of my apartment to the middle of nowhere, switched job multiple times and finally started learning SwiftUI.
Yes SwiftUI, the shiny new declarative way to build iOS. Coming from React, it's a really nice way to get into native iOS development.
Built a <MagicLink invertColor text="CashApp clone" url="https://github.com/casprine/cashapp"/>

and a <MagicLink invertColor text="Clubhouse UI clone" url="https://github.com/casprine/clubhouse-clone" /> with it.

Joined the native team at <MagicLink invertColor text="ChipperCash" url="https://chippercash.com/" />,
currently building a React Native component library that powers our mobile application.
Writing my learnings from building the component library on my blog. Keep an eye out for it in the coming weeks.

Really looking forward to exploring more with SwiftUI, trying out Jetpack Compose and taking another stab at backend development with NodeJS & Elixir in 2022.

export default function ({ children }) {
  return <WritingLayout meta={meta}>{children}</WritingLayout>;
